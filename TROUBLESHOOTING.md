# AI Tech Lead - Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### üî¥ Issue: "GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY not found in environment variables"

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR:agents.reporter_agent:GitHub authentication failed: GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY not found in environment variables
```

**Root Cause:**
Environment variables are not properly configured or have incorrect names.

**Solution:**
1. **Check your `.env` file** in the project root directory
2. **Verify the variable names match exactly:**
   ```env
   GITHUB_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
   GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
   your_private_key_content_here
   -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
   GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Common naming mistakes:**
   - ‚ùå `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (incorrect)
   - ‚úÖ `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` (correct)

4. **Test your environment:**
   ```bash
   python test_env.py
   ```

### üî¥ Issue: Gemini API 404 Model Not Found

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR:agents.reviewer_agent:Error during AI code review: 404 models/gemini-pro is not found
```

**Solution:**
This has been fixed in the latest version. The code now uses `gemini-2.5-flash`. If you still see this error, make sure you have the latest code.

### üî¥ Issue: "'str' object has no attribute 'get'"

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR:agents.reporter_agent:Error in report generation/posting for PR: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
```

**Solution:**

### üî¥ Issue: "Method withRequester(Requester) must be called first"

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR:agents.reporter_agent:GitHub authentication failed: Method withRequester(Requester) must be called first
AssertionError: Method withRequester(Requester) must be called first
```

**Root Cause:**
Incompatibility with PyGithub 2.8.1+ authentication API changes.

**Solution:**
This has been fixed by updating the GitHub authentication code. The fix changes:
```python
# OLD (doesn't work with PyGithub 2.8.1+):
return Github(installation_auth.token)

# NEW (works with PyGithub 2.8.1+):
return Github(auth=installation_auth)
```

**Test the fix:**
```bash
python test_github_auth.py
```

- But workflow fails with authentication errors
- Logs show partial success but report posting fails

**Solution:**
1. **Verify all environment variables are set correctly:**
   ```bash
   python test_env.py
   ```

2. **Restart your application** after fixing environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current process (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
